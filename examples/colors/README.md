This is a client/server app. Open two terminals and run npm install in the client and server
directories.

To run the server app run npm start from the server directory, this will create a socket io server on port 8090. 

For hot module loading run  webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0 from the client directory. Updates to the any of the client files should hot load.

For a nice demo open 2 browsers to http://host:8080
